                 Neobrutalism is an aesthetic characterized by high contrast
                 elements, bright colors, and bold shapes. It is often used to make
                 a statement, as it is meant to be eye-catching and stand out to
                 the viewer. It is also used in user interface and web design, with
                 features such as vibrant colors and bold shapes. Neobrutalism can
                 also be used in print design, with an example being a bold shape
                 with a vibrant color fill applied to it.
